file that is given as input to the linker is called the linker produces an which in turn is used as input by the blurb from portable executable and common object file format virtual in an image the address of an after it is loaded into the base address of the image subtracted from the rva of an almost always differs from position within the file on disk an object an rva is meaningful because memory are not in this an would be an address within a later in this which a relocation is later during for compiler should just set the first in each section to same as except that the base address of image file is not address is called a windows creates a distinct va for each independent physical for almost a va should be just an a va is not predictable as an rva because loader might not load the image at preferred after reading i still get lot of can any one explain it in a practical please stick to terminology of as i know about is that in the object file nor in the image we know the exact memory locations while generating object file computes addresses relative to sections function taking multiple object files as input generates one image while it first merges all the sections of each object file and while merging it recomputes the address offsets again relative to each there is nothing like global there is some thing wrong in what i please correct reading answer given clear about whats physical va rva and what are the relation between of all must be computed by the linker during value of rva of a offset from the beginning of the must been but its why checked this by using on and found fileoffset are same till the beginning of is the first section in this the beginning of through till the last byte of last section rva fileoffset are also the rva of first byte of the first section is being shown as thing is that bytes of each section are continuous in i mean another section begins at the next byte of a last but if i see the same thing in these is a huge gap in between rvas of last byte of a section and first byte of next the bytes of data that the first are actually va space of the of data are just used describe these can be they are not loaded into of the usage of rva is also meaningless this reason why for these term is valid for only those bytes which will be actually the va bytes of are such of starting from rva peview software is from cannot understand why the 3rd i cannot rva virtual	
my app i use perhaps a variation to your potential solution somewhat difficult to explain but i chain and defer lazy loading in my model with custom so as to abstract away from the differed execution that i take advantage of with domain model and service layer upwards does not necessarily have to depend on the linqtosql provider can swap out my dal with interfaces if i want service methods can and do return complete object graphs with multiple for lazy loading using classes that abstract away a particular lazy loading implementation so i can use differed execution or something else anon refer to can maintain results throughout my app to the ui if i want thus allowing infinite linq query chaining without having to worry about

further support ivans answer above lucene is the way to you mentioned what platform on so point out that you can use a port of this you do use lucene there is a very good book from manning on the subject which i recommend you look it comes to populating your you have a couple of for starters you can just dump all of your text into the index and allow the engine to just search on recommend adding fixed fields to your index which will allow you to support things such as partitioned searches or searches against those fields lets say you have a field for the then you can partition your index by restricting the index search to those documents that have that website in that other process is to extract points of interest from your document and allow searches on those without searching the entire index your mileage may vary with this as the lucene engine is very well written so it may simply allow you to collect your searches into more logical units which helps you with your done this myself and it helps when answering management questions about what exactly is searched and

already specified within the answeres different frameworks address different reality i understand your as said by johnny linq a but a subset you may work with it even though not using any of the other frameworks you or as far as i prefer there are so many people who contributes to these projects that you may have the support required by whoever else uses the same opensource product as you proprietary products in the best way to go is to understand how a framework works so that you may use it at its depending on your some prefer opensource and others prefer framework to that is a good question for the skill you say you my humble point of i really like microsoft enterprise library which is an opensource framework for whatever the project working for most of the programs write will require a database connection or enterprise through its daab access application provides a set of tools out of the box which will allow you to build systems without to change or recompile your but simply by enterprise library has been asked to microsoft to maintain by such companies as hp and some other big companies that we might even ignore the when it comes to connect to a i am using enterrise i even built my own framework based on it to even ease the process of connecting to a database without having to worry about the for as you mentionned this is an integration framework to help you map your logical objects to your relational data tables within your such frameworks as entity framework does the except that entity as far as i stands only for sql if developping a system for an oracle entity framework will not provide you the tools you unless i ignore a further support for a larger range of database the advantage of nhibernate is that this is compatible with near any database engines in the i even know that nhibernate allows to write your code solely in and when time to persist your nhibernate may create itself the database schema for your proper database engine without having to write a dsl structure talk for myself when i say i prefer using nhibernate along with enterprise both opensource this helps and light you up a but master the basics of otherwise have a trying to learn to use these

have a bug that shows up every few months on a customer it usually happens at 3am and not discovered until early the next morning when the customer arrives at their and usually when they discover they want everything to get working so our support people generally just reboot the been driving me nuts for it never happens on my test machine or in the qa only at certain customer over some of the code that i thought was causing more debugging printouts around where it appears to be stdout so that next time i see it i can the support some new tools to dump out the current state of database locks and the diagnostics to make it more obvious when it does happened in a few and got my fingers crossed that i might have fixed it this but not counting on
