want to use a to change a is my trans i try to build i get this implicitly convert type to tried making to but then the control this code has worked fine for me in in the setting a opacity should i use a decimal or
have an absolutely positioned containing several one of which is a relatively positioned when i use a on the child it collapses to width on but not on firefox or i use it if the parent is relatively the percentage width on the child there something missing there an easy fix for this besides the on the there an area of the specification that covers the percentage width child in absolutely positioned parent
explicit cast to double trans the constant as as is trans trans
there any conversion tools for porting from code to for converting visual code to

do you expose a query as an web from the business i can return a typed or which can be serialized for transport over can i do the same for a is there a way to populate a typed or via a static mydatatable string conn mydatabasedatacontext db new mydatatable dt new execute a sproc via var query from dr in select copy linq query resultset into a datatable does not work dt return can i get the resultset of a query into a or is the query serializeable so that i can expose it as an web a dataset or datatable from a linq query result
do i store binary data in data in

are welcome in any looking for the fastest way to obtain the value of as a personal more specifically using ways that involve using constants like or the number program below tests the various ways i know the inline assembly version in the fastest though clearly not included it as a baseline to compare the other versions in my with the version is fastest on gcc because it the into a with the version is the main testing program iters diff time1 for i diff time2 time inline return int double the atan2 case catches atan folding optimise the to a if is not extern double actual tests start return the inline assembly stuff noting that it will only work for x86 and x64 double return a build script that builds all the configurations testing from testing between various compiler flags compared against because the optimisations are also tried switching the order of the tests the version still comes out top every is the fastest way to get the value of
years to provide an calculator on my i wrote a function to calculate age to a this is a quick port of that function to php afraid i been able to test the but hope you enjoy all the this is a bit gimmicky for the purposes of showing user profiles on stack but maybe readers will find some use for datetime double years if date2 and date1 are on different of 29 then our partial year is considered to have days otherwise note that 59 is the day of 29 double fraction 59 1 the only really nontrivial case is if date1 is in a leap and date2 is so handle the others if return years if date2 is in a leap but date1 is not and is march shift up by a if return years 59 1 if date1 is not on 29 shift down date1 by a day march or proceed if return years 59 1 here date1 is on 29 and date2 is not on a what to do on 28 feb in the should be just shy of a whole and on 1 mar should just perhaps the easiest way is to a point between those return years
best way that i know of because of leap years and everything birthdate new age this
i have a trigger the on a how can i throw an error that prevents the update on that an error in a mysql
been having issues getting the c sockets api to work properly in although i am including i still get compile time errors telling me that is not am i missing something or could this be related to the fact that doing this coding on and my problems are much more upon further i discovered that there is an that apparently happy unless i define which type of sockets using with a i personally have no idea what this oe sockets thingy and if any sockets programmers are out there 3 of perhaps you could give me a rundown of how this all to use the c socket api in on
answer by phpguy is correct but i think there is a lot of confusing additional detail the basic answer is a blob blob is short for binary large object and that column type is specifically for handling binary relevant manual

already specified within the answeres different frameworks address different reality i understand your as said by johnny linq a but a subset you may work with it even though not using any of the other frameworks you or as far as i prefer there are so many people who contributes to these projects that you may have the support required by whoever else uses the same opensource product as you proprietary products in the best way to go is to understand how a framework works so that you may use it at its depending on your some prefer opensource and others prefer framework to that is a good question for the skill you say you my humble point of i really like microsoft enterprise library which is an opensource framework for whatever the project working for most of the programs write will require a database connection or enterprise through its daab access application provides a set of tools out of the box which will allow you to build systems without to change or recompile your but simply by enterprise library has been asked to microsoft to maintain by such companies as hp and some other big companies that we might even ignore the when it comes to connect to a i am using enterrise i even built my own framework based on it to even ease the process of connecting to a database without having to worry about the for as you mentionned this is an integration framework to help you map your logical objects to your relational data tables within your such frameworks as entity framework does the except that entity as far as i stands only for sql if developping a system for an oracle entity framework will not provide you the tools you unless i ignore a further support for a larger range of database the advantage of nhibernate is that this is compatible with near any database engines in the i even know that nhibernate allows to write your code solely in and when time to persist your nhibernate may create itself the database schema for your proper database engine without having to write a dsl structure talk for myself when i say i prefer using nhibernate along with enterprise both opensource this helps and light you up a but master the basics of otherwise have a trying to learn to use these

requires a constant amount of memory to keep track of results
