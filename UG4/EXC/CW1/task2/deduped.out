150k rows per the size of a these rows contain redundant data that you might be able to minimize by just keeping generall always a good thing to keep tables small so that index updates go through as mentioned by ben s above your queries should be optimized at least so that no access to columns with missing you can find some possible issues using explain and in the slow query log of your mysql server if got it thing that might help you with performance issues is the memcached using it you can delay writes to your thereby taking out some of the steam and still suffer from dirty caches and though depending on the application framework using any at it requires some work to implement this into your archiving and statistics purpose i suggest you take a look at infobright an open source mysql drop in replacement on designated purpose is to be a data warehouse you can use it for all sorts of data analysis got a very nice compression that in our case reduces of raw data to about compressed i guess needless to say that querying specific rows of compressed data be quite but for statistics pretty darn so if not querying specific rows but instead analyze things like many rows got updated with value foo bar between dec 08 and feb it will give you very good in as you use the db it will analyze your usage and create a knowledge grid that will optimize data for your specific next question that would come to my mind if data that keeping for a or some is a relational db the right tool for the knowing the exact nature of your application i could imagine some sort of sessions could reside in a terracotta cluster for that write a transaction log and commit their data every so often might be better but as i that depends heavily on your nature and the ammount of data in

1992 to 1993 timeframe was pivotal and fateful for the time frame i worked on a plugin architecture for aldus which was coded in pagemaker was built on a oop framework called which assisted its portability between mac os and we tried to use the features of to build a plugin this proved to be very problematic for classes due to the brittle base class proceeded to write a paper that was published in journals and that i presented at oopsla in a reflection you can read the pdf format of the paper i presented invariant virtual member function dispatching for evolvable to the bottom and click or also made contact with bjarne stroustrup at a usenix conference in portland and proceeded to dialog with him for several where he championed the issue of dealing with the brittle base class problem on my other issues were deemed more important at that time for trying to shepard rtti through at this time introduced the system for the windows platform that was looked on as a viable solution to the could be used as an implementation language for com via abstract classes used to define com these days developers shun and especially that was based on 1994 i went on to work at microsoft and used and there for the remainder of the i came to conclude that the technology combination was a definite i refer to that experience effective enterprise distributed software contrast to all this early steve devised a plugin architecture using objective c during the early and that was integral to the next step today that lives on vibrantly in mac os x on computers and important platforms such as the submit objective c enabled solving the plugin problem in a superior champions of java will cite factors such as garbage collection as to why it is more productive than i dispute but objective c has not had garbage collection until very recently with on the iphone garbage collection is still not the os x plugin architecture has been entirely viable due entirely to the merits of objective c style of oop vs java has been used to build the most pervasive plugin architectures that exist for any platform or software development the eclipse ide plugin which by now is practically as such architectures incorporated a few years ago the equinox osgi module management j2ee app servers have supported a for ejbs for a these days all j2ee app servers of note have likewise incorporated osgi to manage runtime bindable the spring framework and its runtime bindable unit of the spring bean has grown to exceed j2ee primarily on the strength of its system for managing the binding in of the spring java community is still struggling to define an official module management standard yet even as things the java platform supports software architectures that incorporate plugin capability more pervasively than any other programming the weaknesses of java as a language relative to and that already has a stronger module implementation in its assembly java is still light years ahead in terms of everyday software systems in wide use that incorporate some form of plugin the java community even consciously realize that this is the underpinning of their continued success as an enterprise development personally regard the brittle base class problem of to be most fatal 17 years have passed since this issue was highlighted to the and to the creator of is it now too late to address 17 years is it too late to fix runtime

3 million records is way too much to handle at my guess is that you are performing an export or something like that which requires that many records to be sent down the one method you could use to reduce this issue would be to have the generate an export and then deliver that file to the client compressing first using zlib or something you are pulling data back to the client for viewing then consider sending summary information and then allowing the client to dig thier way thru the data a portion at a the users would thank you because your performance will go way up and they have to dig thru records they care about looking records is way too much to handle at if you had that many would you be able to carry them but if you made it into larger you if your sending data to the client for a then i strongly suggest a summary give them the large picture and let them drill slowly into the send grouped data and then let them open up this is a search results then set a limit of the number of records to be returned for example to display 100 set the limit to still only display the last record means that there were more than 100 records so the customer needs to adjust thier search criteria to return a smaller

5 is almost completely backwards compatible with java the only change you make when you migrate is to rename any usages of the new keyword in the java 4 full list of potential compatibility problems is listed only other one that run into in practice is related to the change in the jaxp in our it simply meant removing from the far as refactoring i think that migrating your collection classes to use the new generic versions and removing unnecessary casting is a good but as another poster pointed changing to generic collections tends to work best if you work in vertical you end up having to add casting to the code to make the generic types compatible with the feature i like to use when migrating code is the it helps to catch inheritance problems when refactoring new concurrency library is very useful if your code uses for you may be able to replace thread pools with a would definitely take the approach of updating the code as you change it during normal other than the compatibility i think there is a compelling reason to use the new java 5 features unless already changing the code for other

a any attempt to slice and dice xml with regular expressions is a real xml parser would do break it 1 is it matches the of the attribute group which is embedded in group matches an attribute and may be repeated 0 or more 2 is most of these pieces are commonly the most unusual is which means repetition in regular the whitespace match at the end is important for without vim will try every possible way to split the whitespace between attributes between the at the end of group 2 and the at the beginning of the next occurrence of group 1 is followed by this is a positive it prevents the from being included in the matched text for 3 is it includes group which matches the beginning of the attribute the is a negative and matches any character this groups matches at any character except where the attribute group 3 is followed by a repetition marker so that it matches the smallest block of text before if you were to use instead of group the matched text could include the of an annotation element that did include match and continue through into the next annotation element with next bit is find match and a minimal number of other characters before the 5 is the end is a positive which is included here for the same reason as the for the we have to repeat rather than use because groups with modifiers

a asp i ventured into webforms world about 5 years after having to handcode things like table in scripting it seemed like webforms would be a tremendous it is until you need even a slight bit of customization beyond alternating row colors and the you could have a gridview running with a few but customizing even what would seem like a simple thing could turn into hours of torture and also think a lot of the examples given in online are oversimplified for the effect of making webforms look sure you can get that gridview to show only 10 records of a record but do you realize that all of the records are being loaded into memory by as an example of the of rectifying that i spent a while creating a pageable gridview that only loads chunks of but it after an hour of i found that you had to delete an extra property that the ide inserts into the not fun when stupid stuff like that sets you at every it even get me started on then the clouds and mvc was handed to now that is a if you are a web you should know whats happening when someone makes a request to your the abstraction and layer of cruft that webforms put on top of that is a the most able to develop applications at the speed of php scripting and finally have total control over the what all as an additional people need to stop complaining that they are creating in mvc views when they find they have to use tags and the drag and drop your gridview onto the set all the then view the crap it gives and your not nearly done now you have to attach events and put more code in your talk about messing up the coding take a simple foreach loop

a big because it leads to unmanageable component and most likely some form of build errors and very likely some deployment at some point in the project life studio 2008 explicitly prevents circular references between projects in as you have that is not the case for i believe that is because vs2008 expects that binary references are managed independently and it expects that you are building those projects generally that means all binary references should be viewed as components that represent a distinct relationship your code and the msbuild allows you to use the sln file to build if all your projects use vb or this allows for the creation of an which is ideal for an automated build the catch is that in order for such a master solution file to all of the projects in the sln must utilize project in order to take advantage of by microsoft expects that you are not employing circular since they are explicitly forbidden by the visual studio ide project hanselman makes reference to an file in the following parallel msbuilds from within the visual studio

a bit but for debugging you can turn on the this will allow you to set up your own error the easiest way to set up said error handling would be to override this will terminate your but it will there may be things you can do to make this not kill your but this will depend on what platform deploying this at any never use this in pretty much going to have to have extensive error handling in one technique used is something like def def print your own error return def raise you use as a decorator on your it will automatically handle whatever errors happened within function is called for some exceptions in but is not getting called for other errors like importerrors import thisclassdoesnotexist in new to is this because of some distinction between and all errors are the reason why this is causing problems is because these errors occur immediately when the module is imported before your view is ever the first method i posted will catch errors like these for you might be able to figure something out for but argue that you have worse problems if getting importerrors in a production app not doing any dynamic tool like can help you eliminate these kinds of problems	
a bit but hopefully getting you for classes are generally pretty easy to it mostly comes down to are created in a simple tree and in actionscript3 the filestructre has to follow the which makes it even can access any class from but if in another package you will need to the this is done by writing an import statement in the beginning of class or interface where you need to use like is an exception to this a class can be declared with the internal in which case the class will only be available within that this is mostly used for helper you should not worry about classes not being create package with the package

a bit more complicated than are actually two totally different versions of old managed extensions for was the only option available in visual available in newer compilers under the option kinda clumsy as it tries hard to integrate with standard so all new keywords lots of are prefixed with double code generated by this compiler is a mixture of native and msil dubbed ijw just new called is a clean new language available in visual 2005 and most it supports several modes of code option again generates a ijw mixture of native and msil results in a although it may translate native types into corresponding the code therefore may not be and can use pointer pretty much like with the strictest of options is which produces verifiable exactly like compiler does that differences between and see description of the compiler see the is called either msil intermediate or cil intermediate mil can stand for media integration the undocumented library used by wpf and vista desktop window

a bit out on a limb but i guess because all the libraries that get added have to do quite a bit of setting up and there is no need to garbage so they simply get to waste even if all memory got it would wait until the first idle which is after the creation of the delete unneeded or force a garbage collect somewhere after loading the window from the nib and see how much it goes down if so am not concerned about some of the memory might be returned and the rest is the price you pay for a powerful

a char is really just a and all that that evalutates whether the bit the in the intx member of whatever pointer points to is not the inverts the so all the 0s become 1s and vice then the 1 i puts a single 1 in the desired combines the two values so that only the desired bit is and the whole thing evalutes to true if that bit was 0 to begin is bitwise it takes each bit in both operands and performs a logical producing a result where each bit is set if either operand had that bit 0b11000000 0b00000011 is an assignment in the same way that means means using bitwise operators can make things easier to read in some but it will usually also make your code significantly slower without strong compiler	
a char must be large enough to hold any character in the basic character has the size suggested by the architecture of the execution note that this means that an int does need to be at least in implementations where is 16 bits are common embedded ot following are taken from various parts of the and c99 has to be at least as large as has to be at least as large as has to be at least as large as that they could all be the same a complement has to be at least has to be at least has to be at least has to be at least 8

a character is distinct from a string is an array of ruby does not have an individual character strings can hold any number of and fixnums can hold the ascii value for a character and be converted to a printable string containing that character with the difference between the and string syntax in ruby has to do with how much preprocessing for is done on the

a check or a it is a check function then it belongs in the since you have a ui and a model assume you have a controller that coordinates between the in that case just call your check function from the validator before calling your save routine which will mark your model as is a command that marks your data as complete then i would think you should change that part of the too messy for my	
a child is the it will automatically be invalidated so that a cycle so you do not need to explicitly track the you just need to override the measureoverride method and then inside the method you can look at the set of children and notice what has this is one area that silverlight is much harder to use than you cannot provide your own collection for storing children like wpf and cannot hook event on the existing children

a class by default does not have own instance of each instances and threads are two separate constructs a member is flagged or some other if you create and then run a separate it will be working on the same instances the separate thread creates its own instances of the threads work on the same instances order to share data and you need to synchronize them the threads never share state or instances of then you do not need to worry about this is rare in though typically threads are working on some type of shared if each spawned thread creates its own and no other threads talk to you can ignore	
a class c in how can i determine which file the class was defined i need something that can work from either the class or from an instance off reason i am doing is because i am generally a fan off putting files that belong together in the same i want to create a class that uses a django template to render itself as the base implementation should infer the filename for the template based on the filename that the class is defined i put a class locationartifact in the file then i want the default behaviour to be that the template name is do i get the filepath for a class in

a class contains an abstract that class must be declared as abstract method has no implementation and classes that derive from that abstract must provide an implementation for this abstract class can have a virtual the virtual method has an you inherit from a class that has a virtual you override the virtual method and provide additional or replace the logic with your own to use some you know that certain types should have a specific you know what implementation this method should such you can create an interface which contains a method with this if you have such a but you know that implementors of that interface will also have another common method which you can already provide the you can create an abstract abstract class then contains the abstract method must be and another method which contains the virtual method should be used if you have a class which can be used but for which you want inheritors to be able to change certain although it is not

a class for the pairs of integers should be the or is this a that all arrays containing a bunch of second thing that these could be read from a as i looked again on this i realized that doubles as keys in a map is somewhat if you produce doubles as a result of an mathematical it is not if they will be equal for the computer if they are equal in a mathematical are represented as approximation in most likely you want to associate the values with the interval and not the value you may avoid if you always use the same constants as keys in the but in this case you could use an enum as and no new programmer runs into if he uses his calculated doubles as keys in the	
a class has a constructor which throws a meaningful error message when construction fails when the score is outside a valid what do you think of that worries me a because calling a ctor requires memory which is relatively for each row calling a ctor and only for its expensive are great when you need but this is a case where you vould use them in a ctor but not in a check refactoring could reduce both by having the check exist as a class static or free then both the check constraint and the ctor could call score int static bool int score return score 0 int s s throw score constraint calls no construction or exception you still have the for each of a clr whether acceptable is something have to there a statement to with check all check constraints on all or do i have to them table by but you can do this to generate the table name with check check constraint from then run the resultset against the from the use base classes called constrainednumber and regexconstrainedstring for all my data i could easily move those two simple constructor code to a separate public boolean isvaluevalid method as you and probably clr overhead memory would only occur for inserts and given the simplicity of the and rate at which table updates will i think the performance impact will anything to worry about for my still really want to raise exceptions for the information provide to management studio i like the isvaluevalid because it gives me the of not throwing within applications using my data i could still get the exception by constructing an instance not sure i agree with the exception but the is that by decomposing the problem into you can select what parts wiling to pay without paying for parts you the ctor you because you were only calling it to get the so we decomposed creation and we can further decompose score int static bool int score return score 0 static int score s throw int s s score a user can call the and get the check and possible exception and call checkvalid and get the check and or isvalid to just get the paying the runtime cost for only what he

a class hierarchy where the base class defines a recursive class extends can i declare another class should not be generic in because such a t could vary over the lifetime of the with a field that can hold any subclass of following does not class b to because the capture of is not sufficiently private public extends end of question noticed a tendency of a number of stackoverflow members to approach certain difficult questions with are you doing that in the first the following is a justification of my use of this pattern you can note that the java standard library also uses recursive in its definition of the enum this question could similarly be asked as to define a field of type class extends public abtract t public return asub1 extends public asub1 return asub2 extends public asub2 return to a parallel class class extends extends implements extends implements with generation of b instances managed by implementations of a bifyer bifyer of this interface may return a bsub1 or bsub2 for the this is essentially an application of the visitor pattern where the bifyer is the but unlike the standard visitor the accept method returns a value instead of this provides a modular framework where different bifyer implementations can be specified to provide alternate behavior and return types for the bify method say one for each subclass of field type for a value of a generically recursive	
a class implements a method such as which accomplishes the same work as then it is recommended to explicitly implement the idisposable so that a developer will typically only see the yet the dispose method is still accessible through the idisposable interface for use by the framework where a dispose method is it makes sense to essentially expose dispose under a different such as where it makes for more readable you see these throughout the framework with things that can be such as file handles and see

a class is various static data about the class is stored in as long as a live reference to this class instance the class instance cannot be garbage believe that part of the problem has to do with whether or not the gc should remove old class instances from perm or every time you hot new class instances are added to the permgen memory and the old now are typically not by the sun jvms will not run garbage collection in but this can be enabled with optional command if you hot deploy enough you will eventually exhaust your permgen your web app does not shut down when undeployed if it leaves a thread for example then all of the class instances used by that web app will be pinned in the permgen you redeploy and now have another whole copy of all of these class instances loaded into you undeploy and the thread keeps pinning another set of class instances in you redeploy and load a whole net set of and eventually your permgen fills can sometimes fix this command arguments to a recent sun jvm to enable gc in permgen and of that a different jvm that employ a fixed sized permgen or that does gc on loaded this will help if your web app shuts down completely and leaving no live references to any of the class instances of any class loaded by the class loaders for that web this will not necessarily fix the due to class loader well as too many interned strings in some out the following links for more two bolded ones have nice diagrams to illustrate part of the the dreaded permgen unknown permgen outofmemoryerror the permanent permgen errors how to deal with out of memory

a cluster can also refer to a specific physical ordering of consider a database with two invoices and if many are inserted chances are that items of the same invoice end up on multiple physical blocks of the underlying when reading such an unneeded data will be read together with the interesting clustering over the foreign key to invoices groups rows of items the same invoice together in the same thus reducing the amount of necessary read operations when accessing the about on a is a number of servers configured to provide the same but look like one server to the can be done for performance reasons servers can answer more requests than a single or redundancy one server the others still configurations often need special software or setup to some like serving static web can be clustered very like need complicated replication schemes to about on a cluster is a of items so that objects from the same cluster are more similar to each other than objects from different about on

a code coverage tells you what you definitely not what you of building a valuable unit test suite is finding the most code and asking hard questions of you want to make sure the tough stuff works as a coverage figures have no notion of the of nor the quality of my many of the most important tests you will ever write are the tests that barely add any coverage at all cases that add a few extra here and but find loads of problem with setting hard and coverage targets is that developers may have to start bending over backwards to test their making code and then just if you hit coverage with great tests then but in most situations the extra effort is just not worth people start with numbers rather than focussing on the quality of the seen badly written tests that have just as seen excellent tests that only have i tend to look at coverage as an indicator of what definitely been

a codebase in which one particular text string occurs the string may be some kind of message for or an xml tag of these examples are usually accompanied by another repeated representing the message footer or the closing as the codebase you notice the string popping up more and more until the bell goes what to turns out all been taught the create a manifest constant or a static final string or depending on the thereby giving the common string a and replace all instances of the string by use of the even a name for this refactoring in martin replace magic number with symbolic duplication duplication in the repeated text of the but in the repeated use of the the resulting code still contains the original by hiding the string behind a my feeling is that made the code less readable right approach after using inline constant to put the original strings back into the code is to look at the context in which each of those strings chances are there will be only a small number of kinds of use of the string perhaps every time a reply message is for if the message has a header and a for look for ways to create an object that builds the with a hook to a function that supplies the message ninety percent of the time that kind of approach but on the odd occasion when it look for ways to encapsulate the string in a simple and then push the surrounding code onto that in either case the result after is that the string is present inline in the but the behavioural context in which that string exists now has a name hopefully a name that is also meaningful in the domain and the domain knowledge or policy represented by the associated code is no longer

a common misconception that oo techniques be applied in most can just that they are slightly more unwieldy than in languages with syntax dedicated to the of the foundations of robust system design is the encapsulation of an implementation behind an and the functions that work with it is a good example of how encapsulation can be applied in c to establish since c lacks access specifiers you enforce that peeks inside a but only a masochist would do polymorphic behaviour can be had in c using tables of function the syntax is ugly but the effect is the same as virtual ianimal int int relying on guaranteed of memory layouts cat struct ianimal int struct x pa calls	
a common mistake to think of as a functional really it is best thought of as a family of but these days when people say lisp they usually mean common lisp allows functional but it a functional language per rather it is a general purpose scheme is a much smaller that is more functional in and of course there are for your question is it a good that really depends on your common lisp particularly has some real strengths for this sort of both interactive and introspective at a level you usually see in scripting making it very quick to develop at the same time its compiled and has efficient so you can expect performance in the same ballpark as other efficient compilers a factor of two of c is typical while a large it has a much more consistent design than things like and the metaprogramming capabilities can make very easy to understand code for your particular if you only look at these lisp looks there are the community is you find many people to help if what looking while the built in library is you find as many 3rd party so you may end up writing more of it from while by no means a walled cl have the kind of smooth integration with foreign libraries that say python which mean you call c there are nice tools for they clos is about the most powerful oo system i can think but it is quite a different approach if coming from a mainstream oo background they but beyond single multiple not that you may find it a bit strange at almost turned inside you go this you are going to have to watch for some issues with performance of the actual rendering if you write that yourself with the class system has incredible runtime flexibility updating class definitions at runtime not via monkey patching but via actually changing the class and updating however you pay some dispatch cost on what used cl in the past for research code requiring numerical simulations of a different it works well for in that case i worried about using existing code it so i was writing pretty much everything from scratch it could be a fine choice of language for this but not the only if you use a language with both aspects and good performance cl as does and a few i would definitely look at the possibility of a two level approach with a language like lua or perhaps python of on top of some c or code doing the heavy	
a common problem when starting to use the entity framework neither parent nor child relationships are lazy loaded so you have to load them if you are going to share the object context around between classes methods you might want to make a check to see if the relationship is already can make this easier with a simple extension static class public static void relatedend if this makes your load call shorter as it uses a which is common to parent and child relationships in the entity you can use this for parent reference relationships too rwwilden if you are always going to load the child objects with the parent in this you might want to use an include to make the call more efficient and avoid an extra roundtrip to the

a current java project we have code similar to the following do nothing or but abort current do nothing or but abort current some more calls to different method do nothing or but abort current you can several different method are called with the exact same object and for every call the same exception is caught and handled the same in a very the exception is not but may only be logged and then only reason why there is a around every single is to always execute all of the no matter if a previously executed method like the above code at it takes up a lot of is very repetitive the logging done in the not presented and just looks can think of some other ways to write this but like them very the following options came to my sequence or daily i i try switch case case case catch do nothing or but abort current is obviously bad very and looks reflection to get objects for the methods to call and store them in a list in the order they are supposed to be then iterate over this list and call the method using as only the exception is handled inside of the like this as bugs example typos in the method only pop up during runtime and the reflection api is somewhat a functor class like class void throws create a list of objects that call the like functors new public void public void iterate this list and call on every can summarize my feeling about this approach with two code i really like all four i would like to discuss this problem what do you feel is the best how did you solve similar problems in the is there maybe a much simpler solution i missed to best execute a set of methods even if an exception	
a cursor is less efficient using a default result in default result set the only sent from the client to the server the packet containing the statement when using a server each fetch statement must be sent the client to the where must be parsed and compiled into execution a statement return a relatively small result that can be cached in the available to the client and you know before executing statement that you must retrieve entire result use a result use server cursors when cursor operations are required support the functionality of or when only part of result set is likely to be not an oracle so i really speak to how the implementations are from a programming set based operations are almost always faster than processing results in a

a custom dotnetnuke i want to be able to send emails based on a i will want to be able to inject text values for certain template i also want the site admins to be able edit the email i want the admins to be able to the layout and text in a fairly foolproof solution is to use localization string to allows customization of the email which email structure hardcoded this is undesireable as it does not allow the admin to modify the solution is to have modules set up to contain the email this has the benefit of allowing the admin to edit the text and it has the drawback that the admin might use a style that is in the css stylesheet that be accessible to an email other thoughts on how to do a 3rd party plugin or module would be for the email modules more about setting up email for the ones i i was not sure i could send emails programmatically from my custom designer access to email templates in

a database as several other posters have suggested will buy you certain things such as transaction security and the possibility of expanding what you store the you need just but maybe later store more and maybe more if your requirements are going to remain as simple as you then going to controversially suggest that using a sql database the simplest solution as i for certain a database does buy you certain very simple solution would be simply to have some directory in every time a client logs you create a file whose name encodes the information you want a hash of identifying and store extra info in the when the client logs you delete the issues need to be careful of include what happens when your app exits splitting among several directories if you have more a couple of thousand clients in particular seems to go ape if you have too many files in a even though principle you should be able to store as many as you and managing filing system virus checker is accessing a file just as you need to simple solution actually as bad as it the filing system is actually designed to access and index things just like a

a default sql server listens on by this can be on a named unless configured sql server listens on a dynamic tcp what that means is should sql server discover that the port is in it will pick another tcp how clients usually find the right port in the case of a named instance is by talking to the sql server listener that listens on and cannot be if you have a named you can configure a static port and if you have a need to use kerberos you need to determine is what port your sql server is listening then need to get with your folks to determine if they allow communication to that port via if they as check your firewall some systems have multiple firewalls laptop is an if need to check all the firewalls on your all of those are verify the server have an ipsec policy that restricts access to the sql server port via ip that also could result in you being brian

a deployment with a process that deploys one at a time and the rest of the system keeps working mufaka this is a tried process that will work with both content files and any compiled piece of the application deploy causes a recycle of the the of this is something you can have the updates go through a and have a single deployment process that controls when to deploy each notice this mean you process each update as you can grab the current updates in the queue and deploy them further updates will arrive to the and will be picked up once the current set of updates is about the questions in the this is a custom solution based on my experience with processes which needs their rate of updates i had the need to use this approach for deployment as for such dynamic content i usually go with a combination of db and cache at different queue need to hold the full it just need to have the appropriate info that will let your process pass the info to start the publishing process with an external as it is custom you can have it join the information to be so you have to deal with that in the publishing db changes would be done during the publishing again you just need to know where the info for the required changes is and let the publishing handle regarding what to use for the the main ones i have used is msmq and a custom implementation with info in sql the queue is just there to control the rate of the so you need anything specially targeted at make sure your db changes are backwards this is really when you are pushing changes live to different

a diagram that should make things more developing a plugin for another program that adds relationships and properties not already included in the these are defined in my tree trying to define this structure abstractly so that i could create implementations of the plugin for different as well as access the information from multiple implementations in a single methods are defined in the but the framework does not know about all the i was hoping i could avoid having the implementation projects pass a list of types to the methods in the framework but it seems i avoid i guess that make sense the methods must have access to the types they are this really explain the problem with as it is a concrete class in the framework i think what is happening is when i serialize the datacontractserializer has access to all the objects and their knowtype parameter and saves them but when i deserialize i create my datacontractserializer with dictionary as the so it only knows about but not the derived classes of tell it what all the derived types are because like i said they are in other projects that the framework project know soooooooo seems like the best solution is to have each implementation pass a list of node types it uses to the serialization and deserialization methods in the framework this make is there a better way to do

a fastcgi application is very similar to the major difference is that you can take advantage of the fact that your process is able to be you can leverage that to gain speed advantages in your you can cache database data in your running changing your application into its own application running behind a fastcgi gateway provided by the web idea is to figure out how to make your means of processing applicable to a fastcgi do you use any specific if move away from if then just start working on talking via an advantage in that there are fastcgi interfaces available for i assume that using some sort of a version control so just make a branch that is for porting to just start thinking about post and put as reading from standard input and your responses as writing to standard may want to also just read through a library that implements a fastcgi interface for an you can find some of those at that might help for you to understand what your application is going to be doing differently in relation to what it is doing	
a faster but you can look at a full worth of bytes per instruction or use simd operations to speed things you can either use a mask and zero test to see if it is even possible if there are any digits in a or if your simd operations are fast enough on large enough you could do iterate through tests for specific numerical values in a vector of bytes faster than doing character for you could do something 0x30 is just for now need to do the test for the next 8 bytes in optimizers might be smart enough to do this for you just from your code sample had better be comparing a ton of bytes to be thinking about optimizations at this level	
a feature called would be handy to write tests on code that might otherwise get into an infinite i would love to write a test such that the second call to a method would raise an libraries for python allow you to sequence so the first returns false and the second raises an do a partial mock with will intercept the first and the rest will be passed on to the original so that but have to create a derive a and give it the ability to raise after the first

a few that put in my code at various some technically but the same sort of a project that needs some special code on one platform will include all the from these comments have been lifted from though they no longer apply to the they may still be of value original tabbing and structural elements have been this has a major bobby tables even if a rulebuilder is still the risk of something getting corrupted in the database text from anywhere and simply slotting it into an sql statement is a major security thanks to xkcd for the name eliminate one bobby tables by changing to be not just straight more comments that are not as end of lifted there should not be any executable code between these why is this a fatal actually very closely akin to the miswart of botched being a when writing a you need your and if you have chances are be a million cascaded so by making to open a the compiler suppresses all those errors about undefined symbols and potentially misspelled type someone tries to import as a field it already have our own but i think the probability is so low that i can afford to be if is a reserved word and cannot be used as a column or a place to squirrel away sql statements temporary because i said is it that squirrels this sets if a tilde header does not exist in the import file the if the entire column it will duplicate down through all of the this is fine for as that will never be and if is that throws an error in with i am not so i think be ok to most of the if the user only ever imports adds or but never both at once in a single so for to allow a blank to revise or breaking the check out to a new variable the in most it be so a but it like it has to copy the entire so only a small so it can waste a big ok going to going to lot of my comments contain obscure references to films or but they be nearly as funny if you know the chris

a few things you can best thing to do is one such should let you mock out only the specific functions you that the next best thing is to provide the implementation of as a method of an object within the i find this one of the easier methods if you mock methods myclass function function return option is to add an so that the method behaves i recommend this either eventually have differing code paths and with their own option would be to subclass and override the behaviors you i suggest this since end up customizing your overridden mock to the point that have bugs itself if you need to mock out a method because its too that be a good sign to move it into its own object and use composition using the technique i mentioned

a few you either get an inefficient or you get poor code with xss not met a bbcode implementation yet that fails to and it better in this to only match using a validation is it better to use and a then ascertain whether or not the input is a valid would take the you need the callback anyway to do the not possible to be secure with only simple string drop the sanitisation in whilst doing about functions like within a actually you need is about encoding query which what you need it be safer to write a is not really amenable to regex because a recursive language which regex also cannot many bbcode holes are caused by nesting and misnesting for come out as something are many other traps that generate broken code to an including xss on various bbcode looking for principles and best you need a language that you can you need the number of possible tags that can be put inside other arbitrary nesting really possible to special characters for and html tag to distinguish them from real angle brackets that should appear as such in the i use ascii control codes previously filtered any control characters out at the user input the string being processed on these control characters on content between these two control so that you never end up letting a bbcode span reach inside a tag or over a tag you have bbcode spans reaching through tag boundaries work from the outside doing large block elements first and working inwards to links and finally bold and process a block at a if starting a new on a no bbcode tags can span between the two separate still damned hard to get a proper parser is much more likely to be	
a few your segfault is probably because passing a which is just a and then trying to it in problem that pointer does not live in it lives in you probably want to either the or use doing it this way will not edit can not just assign name to the if you do get unpredictable results and probably still in objects are locally scoped unless allocated on the in this in your want to do something new name 1 name in the want to do something my syntax may be completely and i realize the above code is inherently unsafe as not checking the to make sure not and not checking the return value of this should get you stand string literals are treated as constant storage and thus live on for the duration of the the i is when not dealing with string passing a pointer you need to allocate storage for it and you also need to appropriately when destroying said

a foreign key to a is the approach i in i use this even when i do use a database that supports enum i may skip the for the lookup and just use the actual value i need in my main table as the primary key of the lookup that way you need to do a join to get the table bugstatus status primary into bugstatus values table bugs serial primary summary status not null default foreign key references storing strings takes more space than implementation of but unless the table in question has millions of it hardly advantages of the lookup table are that you can add or remove a value from the list with a simple or whereas with you have to use to redefine the try querying the current list of permitted values in an for instance to populate a in your user a major with a lookup status from you can add other attribute columns to the lookup table if you need to to mark choices available only to in an you annotate the just simple option besides a lookup table would be to use the database supports them mysql table bugs serial primary summary status not check in this use of a constraint suffers from the same disadvantages as the hard to change the list of values without hard to query the list of permitted hard to annotate the equality comparison operator in sql is a single the double has no meaning in

a form is just a place to display data and allow for user input and the state information is held not in the form but in the underlying then probably no compelling reason not to just create a new form when you need think the form is the place to be holding any state info about your program and thus you ought to be able to close the form and make a new one without any i always follow my own advice and state often creeps into my form probably because it is so convenient to do guess a consideration would be if there was significant construction necessary to bring a form and its various controls into populate it with data and display it to the

a getter method is a better design choice for a class as it allows you to replace the getter method with something more complicated in the although this seems less likely to be needed for a const the cost is low and the possible benefits are an in an especially good idea to give both the getter and setter for a member same since in the future you can then actually change the the pair of foo void a public member variable that defines an for this class encapsulates a fancier type of const return does some internal void does some internal foo client code will need to be recompiled of but no syntax changes are this transformation works just as well for const in which only a getter is

a good idea to have some sort of central because allow for you to share but also have a branch somewhere that you can directly generate your your snapshots that server will probably have more than one one of which is thought of as a any previous releases will have their own and depending on the hierarchy of your team if you are divided into groups with each group working on one aspect of the then there may be team or feature based though if you work that way not because it is distributed each developer will also have their own local to make things nice and or they can each have multiple for instance a developer who likes to work while commuting may have a repository on his and another one on his with branches on his laptop that are from the ones on his up to i guess that the part makes this kind of thing a lot because you can commit and even branch while you are away from the transitioning from a then you can just slip straight into the same model as because a dvcs is flexible enough to work in the same you can just start with a single central repository with a few and it is always trivially easy to create more repositories and branches last thing is that you still need the fact that various developers each have copies of the same thing adds but it is not dvcs i use regularly is i have also tried
