# JavaScript - The Cool Kid on the Block

When first Netscape engaged in direct competiton with Microsoft for the browser of the web, it was apparent that the ability to support client side scripting could provide an edge and deliver marker share [1]. When finally Brendan Eich, a Netscape employee at that time, developed JavaScript in 10 days, it became part of the Netscape Navigator 2.0 in 1995 and thus JavaScript was born. Time has gone by with JavaScript mostly being used for cliend side scripting until Ryan Dahl paired Google's V8 JavaScript engine with an event loop resulting in the first build of Node.js which supported JavaScript on the server side. Shortly after, the Node Package Manager was born and the ecosystem of JavaScript has sky rocketed. Developers rejoiced and started embedding JavaScript in, well, everything - servers, smartphones, RaspberryPIs, smart fridges and even launching rockets has become a domain for Javascript [3]. It has effectively become the most popular language [4] by GitHub metrics.

With the unprecedented rise of JavaScript, a direct question arises - what is next? Alternatively, one might ask how will the change of the software development ecosystem be impacted by JavaScript. This article explores the aspects making JavaScript a rockstar as well the impact it has had on the development of software development paradigms and practices for the future.
